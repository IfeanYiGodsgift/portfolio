## Project Description
This personal portfolio is built with a **Linux/CLI (Command Line Interface)** aesthetic to reflect my specialization in **Backend Systems, Linux Environments, and Automotive Engineering**.

Unlike traditional portfolios, this site offers an interactive terminal experience where users can type commands (or click links) to navigate, mimicking a real shell environment.

## Features
* **Interactive Shell:** Users can type commands like `help`, `projects`, and `contact`.
* **Mobile Optimized:** Includes a "Click-to-Run" interface so mobile users don't need to type.
* **Real-time Typing Effect:** Custom JavaScript engine simulates retro terminal text rendering.
* **Command History:** Supports `Arrow Up/Down` to cycle through previous commands.
* **Easter Eggs:** Try running `sudo` or `matrix` for hidden interactions.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (No frameworks)
* **Deployment:** Vercel
